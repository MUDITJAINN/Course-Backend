--> Headers in Postman
Headers are key-value pairs sent with your request that provide metadata to the server.

Common uses:
Authorization: e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: e.g., application/json tells the server the data is in JSON
Accept: tells the server what response format the client expects (like application/json)
Think of headers like the envelope of a letter – it helps route and understand the data inside.


--> 🔐 Authorization: Bearer <token> – What It Does
This header is used to securely authenticate your request to an API.

🔸 Bearer Token Explained:
A token is like a digital key that proves you are allowed to access certain data or perform actions.
When you include Authorization: Bearer <token> in the request header:
You're telling the server: “Here is my token — please verify it and let me in.”
The server checks if the token is valid, not expired, and has permission.
